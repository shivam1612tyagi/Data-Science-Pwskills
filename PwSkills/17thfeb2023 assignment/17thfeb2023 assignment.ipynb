    "MongoDB is a popular document-based NoSQL database that is designed to be highly scalable and flexible. It is an open-source \n",

    "from document to document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, differ from traditional relational databases in that they do not use a\n",
    "tabular structure to store data. Instead, they use different data models like document-based, key-value, graph, or column-family\n",
    "to store data. This makes NoSQL databases more flexible and scalable, especially for handling large volumes of unstructured or\n",

    "MongoDB is often preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where there is a need for:\n",

    "1.Flexibility: MongoDB allows developers to work with semi-structured and unstructured data easily, which makes it more flexible than SQL databases, where the data must be modeled into a strict schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Scalability: MongoDB is designed to scale out horizontally, which makes it easy to scale up to handle large amounts of data or traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Performance: MongoDB can provide better performance than SQL databases, especially for read-intensive workloads or when dealing with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.High availability: MongoDB provides features like replica sets and sharding, which helps to ensure high availability and prevent data loss.\n",

    "4.Aggregation framework: MongoDB has a powerful aggregation framework that allows you to perform complex data processing on your collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Ad hoc queries: MongoDB supports ad hoc queries, which means that you can query your data without having to define a schema or structure beforehand. This makes it easy to work with dynamic and evolving data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Automatic sharding: MongoDB can automatically partition your data across multiple servers or nodes, which makes it easy to handle large volumes of data.\n",
