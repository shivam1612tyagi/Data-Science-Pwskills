    "Ans:\n",

    "Q5. What is the curse of dimensionality in KNN?\n",
    "Ans: The curse of dimensionality in KNN refers to the problem of increasing feature dimensions in the dataset, where the distance between points becomes less meaningful as the number of dimensions increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can lead to sparsity of the data, where the distance between any two points becomes almost equal, making it difficult to distinguish between them.\n",

    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "One common approach to handling missing values in KNN is to use the imputation technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "This involves replacing the missing values with estimated values based on the available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach to imputation is to replace the missing values with the mean or median of the available data in the same feature.\n",

    "Another approach is to use KNN imputation, where the missing values are estimated based on the values of the k-nearest neighbors in the same feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another technique is to use multiple imputations, where the missing values are estimated multiple times using different imputation methods, and the results are combined to improve the accuracy of the imputation."

    "\n",
    "The strengths of the KNN algorithm include its simplicity, flexibility, and effectiveness in certain types of datasets.\n",
    "KNN can work well with nonlinear, non-parametric, and high-dimensional data.\n",

    "However, there are also some weaknesses to the KNN algorithm.\n",

    "To address these weaknesses, techniques such as cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction can be applied to optimize the performance of KNN.\n",

    "Q10. What is the role of feature scaling in KNN?\n",
    "Ans: Feature scaling is the process of normalizing the range of features to a common scale in order to prevent the dominance of certain features over others in the KNN algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since KNN relies on calculating distances between data points, the features with larger ranges or scales may dominate the distance calculations and bias the algorithm towards those features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature scaling can be done using techniques like standardization or min-max scaling. Standardization scales the features to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, while min-max scaling scales the features to a range between zero and one.\n",
    "\n",
    "By scaling the features, the KNN algorithm can be more accurate and reliable, and the distances between data points can be more meaningful."
