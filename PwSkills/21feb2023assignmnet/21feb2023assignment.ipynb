    "1.Manual scraping: This is the most basic method of web scraping, where data is manually copied and pasted from web pages into \n",
    "                   a spreadsheet or text editor. It is time-consuming and not scalable, but it may be useful for small projects \n",

    "2.Web scraping software: There are several web scraping software tools available that automate the process of web scraping. \n",
    "                         These tools can extract data from web pages and save it in a structured format such as CSV, JSON, or \n",
    "                         XML.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.APIs: Some websites provide APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow users to access data in a structured format. \n",
    "        APIs are a reliable and scalable way to extract data from websites, but they may require authentication and often have \n",
    "        usage limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Parsing HTML: HTML parsing involves analyzing the HTML structure of a web page to extract data. This can be done using \n",
    "                programming languages like Python or Ruby, and libraries like Beautiful Soup and Nokogiri.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Headless browsing: Headless browsing involves using a browser to scrape data from a website, without actually rendering the \n",
    "                     page. This method can be useful for scraping dynamic websites that use JavaScript, but it requires more \n",
    "                     technical expertise.\n",

    "6.Proxy servers: Some websites may block web scraping attempts, so it may be necessary to use proxy servers to avoid detection. \n",
    "                 Proxy servers allow users to access websites from a different IP address, making it more difficult for websites\n",
