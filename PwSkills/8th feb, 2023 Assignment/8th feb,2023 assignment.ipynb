    "1. Abstraction is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) that refers to the process of hiding complex \n",
    "   implementation details behind a simplified interface.\n",
    "2. The idea behind abstraction is to present an object or a system in a way that focuses on what it does, rather than how it \n",
    "   does it.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. we all use the social platforms and contact our friends, chat, share images etc., but we donâ€™t know how these operations are \n",

    "Answer:\n",
    "No.You cannot create an instance of an abstract class in most programming languages,including python.\n",
    "An abstract class in meant to be a blueprint for other classes,but it cannot be instatiated on its own.\n",
    "The ourpose of an abstract class is to define a common interface for a group of related classes,but not to be used as an object\n",
    "in its own right.\n",
    "    \n",
    "for example:\n",
    "Consider an abstract class 'shape' that defines a common interface for all shapes in a @D space.\n",
    "The \"shape' class might have an abstract method 'area()' that calculates the area of a shape,but it wouldn't make sense to \n",
    "create shape.\n",
    "subclasses of the 'shape' class such as 'circle' and 'rectangle', that implement the 'area' method and can be instantiated as \n",
    "objects.\n",
    "        \n",
    "In summary, an abstract class is tool for craeting a common interface for a group related classes, but it cannot be instantiated \n",
    "as an object in its own right.\n",
    "To use an abstract class, you must create a concrete sub class that implements the abstract methods defined in the base class."
